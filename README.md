## Spring Boot Security Method Level

### Spring Security:
Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications.
Spring Security is a framework that focuses on providing both authentication and authorization to Java applications. Like all Spring projects, the real power of Spring Security is found in how easily it can be extended to meet custom requirements

### Spring Security Features:
- Comprehensive and extensible support for both Authentication and Authorization

### Project Descriptions:
please see application.properties files in resources folder and select a active profile "dev" or "com" to run project. you can check test methods too.  

Apart from authentication, spring security also check authorization of the logged in user. After login which user is authorize to access the resource is done on the bases of user's ROLE.
At the time of creating user in WebSecurityConfig class, we can specify user's ROLE as well.
Security applied on a method restricts to unauthorized user and allow only authentic user.
